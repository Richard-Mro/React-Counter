## About This Project 📚
This Project is made up of a Custom Counter Hook with SetValue, Reset, Increment and Decrement functions just like it was stated in the question, It was also given very beautiful UI(User Interface), It consists of three pages:

*The Custom Counter Hook* Which has the Counter

*The Error Page* which is to test Error Boundary and this throws an intentional error to be caught by the error boundary component.

*404 Page not found Page* Which displays the 404 Not Found Page when a user visits a non-existing route

## Approach: 🚶
A Navigation Bar was Created for the Counter Page to enable Navigation from one Page to another and styled it to be responsive for different Kind of Screens, Dark and Light theme was also created for an overall better User experience/ Interface, There is a button at the bottom of the screen to enable that effect.
